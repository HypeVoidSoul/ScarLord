LOG =  """
*Admins only:*
• `/logchannel`*:* get log channel info
• `/setlog`*:* set the log channel.
• `/unsetlog`*:* unset the log channel.

Setting the log channel is done by:
• adding the bot to the desired channel (as an admin!)
• sending `/setlog` in the channel
• forwarding the `/setlog` to the group
