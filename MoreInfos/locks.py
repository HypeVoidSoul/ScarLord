Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures? \
You're in the right place!
The locks module allows you to lock away some common items in the \
telegram world; the bot will automatically delete them!

 • `/locktypes`*:* Lists all possible locktypes
 
*Admins only:*
 • `/lock <type>`*:* Lock items of a certain type (not available in private)
 • `/unlock <type>`*:* Unlock items of a certain type (not available in private)
 • `/locks`*:* The current list of locks in this chat.
 
Locks can be used to restrict a group's users.
eg:
Locking urls will auto-delete all messages with urls, locking stickers will restrict all \
non-admin users from sending stickers, etc.
Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.

*Note:*
 • Unlocking permission *info* will allow members (non-admins) to change the group information, such as the description or the group name
 • Unlocking permission *pin* will allow members (non-admins) to pinned a message in a group
