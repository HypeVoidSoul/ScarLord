CONNECTION =  """
Sometimes, you just want to add some notes and filters to a group chat, but you don't want everyone to see; This is where connections come in...
This allows you to connect to a chat's database, and add things to it without the commands appearing in chat! For obvious reasons, you need to be an admin to add things; but any member in the group can view your data.

 • `/connect`: Connects to chat (Can be done in a group by `/connect` or `/connect <chat id>` in PM)
 • `/connection`: List connected chats
 • `/disconnect`: Disconnect from a chat
 • `/helpconnect`: List available commands that can be used remotely

*Admin only:*
 • `/allowconnect <yes/no>`: allow a user to connect to a chat
